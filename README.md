This documents the process for crating a USB bootable instance of Windows 10 or Windows 11. There are other documents avaiable on the Internet, but I found them inadequate for clarity or providing some explanation for the process. I hope this remedies that situation.

The guide can be found here - [Windows 10 on USB Installation Guide](https://github.com/BandedHawk/windows-on-usb/blob/main/windows-on-usb.md)
